Easily add Vipps and MobilePay branding to your store. Add badges on the product pages with drag-and-drop app blocks and add icons in the footer.
This will help you build trust in your store. Many merchants have requested this feature, and now it's finally here.

*Companion app for Shopify* also supports synchronizing relevant order data with the Vipps or MobilePay app
(e.g., product image, price details, shipping, tax, total price).
This gives your customers a lot more information within the app.

The companion app can be used in combination with both the
[Checkout app for Shopify](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/plugins-ext/checkout-shopify/)
or [Payment app for Shopify](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/plugins-ext/shopify/).
